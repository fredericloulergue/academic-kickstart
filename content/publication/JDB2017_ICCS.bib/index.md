abstract = "The BSP model (Bulk Synchronous Parallel) simplifies  the construction and evaluation of parallel  algorithms, with its simplified synchronization  structure and cost model. Nevertheless, imperative  BSP programs can suffer from synchronization errors.  Programs with textually aligned barriers are free  from such errors, and this structure eases program  comprehension.  We propose a simplified  formalization of barrier inference as data flow  analysis, which verifies statically whether an  imperative BSP program has replicated  synchronization, which is a sufficient condition for  textual barrier alignment."
