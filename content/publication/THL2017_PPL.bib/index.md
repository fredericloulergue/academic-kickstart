abstract = "Bulk-Synchronous Parallel (BSP) is a bridging model  between abstract execution and concrete parallel  architectures that retains enough information to  model performance scalability. In order to model BSP  program executions, Hains adapted the theory of  finite automata to the BSP paradigm by introducing  BSP automata.  In the initial description of the  theory, BSP automata had to be explicitly defined as  structured sets of states and transitions. The lack  of a clean and efficient algorithm for generating  them from regular expressions would have prevented  this theory from being used in practice.  To  alleviate this problem we introduce in this paper an  algorithm that generates a BSP automaton recognizing  a BSP language defined by a BSP regular  expression. The main practical use of BSP automata  developed in this paper is the parallelization of  finite state automata with an explicit distribution  and a performance model, that enable parallel  matching of regular expressions. Secondarily, BSP  regular expressions provide a convenient structure  for automatic code generation of imperative BSP  program that is also developed in this paper."
