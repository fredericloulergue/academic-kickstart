abstract = "Frequent itemset mining is one pillar of machine   learning and is very important for many data mining   applications. There are many different algorithms   for frequent itemset mining, but to our knowledge no   implementation has been proven correct using   computer aided verification. Hu et al. derived on   paper an efficient algorithm for this problem,   starting from an inefficient functional program and   by using program calculation derived an efficient   version. Based on their work, we propose a formally   verified functional implementation for frequent   itemset mining developed with the Coq proof   assistant. All the proposed programs are evaluated   on classical datasets and are compared to a non   verified Java implementation of the Apriori   algorithm.  "
