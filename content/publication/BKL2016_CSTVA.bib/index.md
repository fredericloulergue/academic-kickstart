abstract = "With the wide expansion of multiprocessor  architectures, the analysis and reasoning for  programs under weak memory models has become an  important concern.  This work presents an original  constraint solver for detecting program behaviors  respecting a particular memory model.  It is  implemented in Prolog using CHR (Constraint Handling  Rules).  The CHR formalism provides a convenient  generic solution for specifying memory models, that  benefits from the existing optimized implementations  of CHR and can be easily extended to new models.  We  briefly present the solver design, illustrate the  encoding of memory model constraints in CHR and  discuss the benefits and limitations of the  proposal.  "
