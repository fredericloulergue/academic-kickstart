abstract = "This paper presents the design and implementation of   a sequential simulator for the parallel functional   language BSML based on the parallel computation   model Bulk Synchronous Parallelism (BSP). This   simulator is implemented in sequential, runs in any   browser, and provides a graphical representation of   the parallel executions.  Due to the pure functional   nature of BSML, the results obtained by this   simulator are the same than the results that could   be obtained by executing the program in parallel"
