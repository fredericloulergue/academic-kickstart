abstract = "Cloud Computing has known in the past few years a   fast development, leading to a spike in the number   of companies competing on providing the best Cloud   services. This makes it harder for potential Cloud   customers to chose the adequate provider. Despite   its wide adoption, many are still hesitant due to   the security issues Cloud Computing poses. In this   paper, we propose a brokerage solution that   formalizes security properties under the form of   inter-VM relations, and gives the possibility of   setting these security requirements to its customers   from the first steps. This solution uses formal   methods and the finite model finder KodKod to verify   the consistency of the customer's requirements, and   to find a placement for his deployment model."
