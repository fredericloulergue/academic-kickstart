abstract = "OCaml is a multi-paradigm (functional, imperative,   object-oriented) high level sequential   language. Types are statically inferred by the   compiler and the type system is expressive and   strong.  These features make OCaml a very productive   language for developing efficient and safe programs.   In this tutorial we present three frameworks for   using OCaml to program scalable parallel   architectures: BSML, Multi-ML and Spoc."
