abstract = "Frama-C is a software analysis framework that  provides a common infrastructure and a common  behavioral specification language to plugins that  implement various static and dynamic analyses of C  programs. Most plugins do not support  concurrency. We have proposed conc2seq, a Frama-C  plugin based on program transformation, capable to  leverage the existing huge code base of plugins and  to handle concurrent C programs.  In this paper we  formalize and sketch the proof of correctness of the  program transformation principle behind conc2seq,  and present an effort towards the full mechanization  of both the for- malization and proofs with the  proof assistant Coq."
