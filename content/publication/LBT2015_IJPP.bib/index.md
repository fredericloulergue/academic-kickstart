abstract = "SyDPaCC is a set of libraries for the Coq proof  assistant. It allows to write naive functional  programs (i.e. with high complexity) that are  considered as specifications, and to transform them  into more efficient versions. These more efficient  versions can then be automatically parallelised  before being extracted from Coq into source code for  the functional language OCaml together with calls to  the Bulk Synchronous Parallel ML (BSML) library. In  this paper we present a new core version of SyDPaCC  for the development of parallel programs  correct-by-contruction using the theory of list  homomorphisms and algorithmic skeletons implemented  and verified in Coq. The framework is illustrated on  the the maximum prefix sum problem."
