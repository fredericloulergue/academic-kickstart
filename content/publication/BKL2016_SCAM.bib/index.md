abstract = "Frama-C is an extensible modular framework for  analysis of C programs that offers different  analyzers in the form of collaborating plugins.  Currently, Frama-C does not support the proof of  functional properties of concurrent code.  We  present conc2seq, a new code transformation based  tool realized as a Frama-C plugin and dedicated  to the verification of concurrent C programs.  Assuming the program under verification respects an  interleaving semantics, conc2seq transforms the  original concurrent C program into a sequential one  in which concurrency is simulated by interleavings.  User specifications are automatically reintegrated  into the new code without manual intervention.  The  goal of the proposed code transformation technique  is to allow the user to reason about a concurrent  program through the interleaving semantics using  existing Frama-C analyzers."
