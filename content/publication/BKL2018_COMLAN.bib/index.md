abstract = "With the wide expansion of multiprocessor   architectures, the analysis and reasoning for   programs under weak memory models has become an   important concern. This work presents MMFilter, an   original constraint solver for generating program   behaviors respecting a particular memory model. It   is implemented in Prolog using CHR (Constraint   Handling Rules). The CHR formalism provides a   convenient generic solution for specifying memory   models. It benefits from the existing optimized   implementations of CHR and can be easily extended to   new models. We present MMFilter design, illustrate   the encoding of memory model constraints in CHR and   discuss the benefits and limitations of the proposed   technique."
