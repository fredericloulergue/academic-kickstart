abstract = "Bulk synchronous parallelism (BSP) oﬀers an abstract  and simple model of parallelism yet allows to take  realistically into account the communication costs  of parallel algorithms. BSP has been used in many  application domains. BSPlib and its variants are  programming libraries for the C language that  support the BSP style.  Bulk Synchronous Parallel ML  (BSML) is a library for BSP programming with the  functional language OCaml. It is based on an  extension of the lambda-calculus by parallel  operations on a data structure named parallel  vector. BSML oﬀers a global view of programs,  i.e. BSML programs can be seen as sequential  programs working on a parallel data structure (seq  of par) while a BSPlib program is written in the  SPMD style and understood as a parallel composition  of communicating sequential programs (par of  seq). The communication styles of BSML and BSPlib  are also quite diﬀerent. "
