abstract = "Parallel programs based on the Divide&Conquer  paradigm could be successfully defined in a simple  way using powerlists.  These parallel recursive data  structures and their algebraic theories offer both a  methodology to design parallel algorithms and  parallel programming abstractions to ease the  development of parallel applications.  The paper  presents how programs based on powerlists can be  implemented in Java using the framework framework  we developed.  The design of this framework is based  on powerlists theory, but in the same time follows  the object-oriented design principles that provide  flexibility and maintainability.  Examples are given  and performance experiments are conducted. The  results emphasise the utility and the efficiency of  the framework."
