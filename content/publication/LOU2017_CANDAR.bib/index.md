abstract = "This paper presents an extension of a library for  the Coq interactive theorem prover that enables the  development of correct functional parallel programs  based on sequential program transformation and  automatic parallelization using an algorithmic  skeleton named accumulate.  Such an algorithmic  skeleton is a pattern of a parallel algorithm that  is provided as a high-order function implemented in  parallel. The use of this framework is illustrated  with the bracket matching problem, including  experiments on a parallel machine."
