abstract = "An important concern addressed by runtime   verification tools for C code is related to   detecting memory errors. It requires to monitor some   properties of memory locations (e.g. their validity   and initialization) along the whole program   execution. Static analysis based optimizations have   been shown to significantly improve the performances   of such tools by reducing the monitoring of   irrelevant locations. However, soundness of the   verdict of the whole tool strongly depends on the   soundness of the underlying static analysis   technique. This paper tackles this issue for the   dataflow analysis used to optimize the E-ACSL   runtime assertion checking tool. We formally define   the core dataflow analysis used by E-ACSL and prove   its soundness."
