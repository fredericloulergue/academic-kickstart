abstract = " Frama-C is a framework that provides a common  infrastructure and a common behavioral specification  language to plugins that implement various static  and dynamic analyses of C programs. Most plugin do  not support concurrency. We have proposed  textscconc2seq a plugin that handles concurrent C  programs, based on program transformation to  leverage the existing huge code base of plugins.  In  this paper we formalize and sketch the correctness  of the program transformation principle behind  textscconc2seq, and present an effort towards the  full mechanization of both the formalization and  proofs with the proof assistant Coq "
